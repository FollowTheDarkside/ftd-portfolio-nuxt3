## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash

If you actually host my project, please use the following command to perform a static build (pre-rendering). This is done automatically with GitHub Actions.

```bash
npx nuxi generate
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information. I also referenced [this article](https://developer.mamezou-tech.com/nuxt/nuxt3-rendering-mode/).
